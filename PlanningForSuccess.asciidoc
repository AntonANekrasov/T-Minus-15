== Planning for Success

This chapter outlines the key elements and best practices necessary for planning and executing successful projects. By following these guidelines, teams can ensure efficient project delivery, high-quality outcomes, and client satisfaction.

=== Epic kick-off

Hold a project kick-off meeting to align all stakeholders on the project goals, timelines, and roles. This meeting sets the tone for the project and ensures everyone understands their responsibilities and the project's objectives.

=== Daily Stand-ups

Conduct daily stand-up meetings to review progress, address blockers, and plan the day’s tasks. Each team member briefly discusses what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any impediments they face.

=== Weekly Checkpoints

In T-Minus-15, we believe that regular Checkpoints are a crucial element in keeping projects on track and stakeholders engaged. These weekly project meetings provide a dedicated space for the entire team, as well as stakeholders, to collaborate and provide valuable feedback throughout the project journey.

*Keeping on Course*: During the Checkpoints, we review the Delivery plan, confirming the scope of Features in the current Sprint and tracking their progress. This ensures that everyone stays aligned with the project's objectives and that the team remains on course to meet milestones effectively.

*Visibility and Transparency*: To gauge the team's progress, we provide an overview of the Sprint burndown, allowing stakeholders to witness the team's performance and project health. This transparency fosters a culture of accountability and open communication, enabling timely adjustments to enhance outcomes.

*Addressing Questions and Tasks*: Checkpoints offer an opportunity to address any open questions that the team needs answering. This helps to eliminate bottlenecks and empowers the Squad to move forward confidently. Additionally, we discuss any tasks that stakeholders may need to undertake to ensure a seamless project flow.

*Tackling Risks and Issues*: In our quest for excellence, we tackle risks and issues head-on during Checkpoints. Identifying potential roadblocks allows us to proactively address challenges and take preventive measures, ensuring smooth progress and minimizing disruptions.

*Showcasing Progress*: A highlight of each Checkpoint is the demonstration of Features currently in the Sprint. This showcases the tangible results of the team's efforts, giving stakeholders a firsthand look at the evolving project and fostering a sense of excitement and ownership.

=== Epic closure

Conduct a project closure meeting to review what was accomplished, what went well, and what could be improved. This meeting provides an opportunity for reflection and ensures all project deliverables are completed and accepted.

=== Delivering High-Value Solutions at High Quality and High Cadence



*Prioritize High-Value Features*: The Scrum Master should work with the Product Owner to ensure that the highest value features are prioritized in the backlog. This ensures that the most critical functionalities are delivered first, providing immediate value to stakeholders.

*Full Lifecycle Coverage*: Ensure that all features go through the complete lifecycle, from planning and design to implementation and testing. This ensures high quality and readiness for production.

*Tracking Progress and Burn Down*: Regularly monitor the sprint burndown chart to ensure that tasks are on track to be completed within the sprint. If any tasks are taking significantly longer than expected, investigate the reasons and address any impediments.

*Quality Assurance*: Implement a robust testing strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing. Ensure critical and major issues are addressed before production deployment.

*High Cadence Delivery*: Maintain a steady pace of delivery, ensuring that increments are delivered regularly. This iterative approach allows for continuous feedback and improvement, ensuring the final product meets stakeholder expectations.

=== Project Success

From our experience, the following points help ensure the successful implementation of a project:

- *Clarity of requirements*: The client should have a clear understanding of their business requirements and goals for the project. They should communicate these requirements to the development team in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that the backlog is a single source of truth.
- *System access*: The client should provide access to the data and systems that will be used in the delivery of the solution. Due to the principle of delivering Feature by Feature, week-by-week this access will need to be given at the commencement of the project.
- *Resource allocation*: The client should allocate appropriate resources to the project, including time, budget, and personnel (product owners, stakeholders, end user testers). This will help ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the desired level of quality. Please see Error! Reference source not found..
- *Engagement*: The client should actively engage with the development team throughout the project. This involves providing feedback, asking (and answering) questions, and addressing any concerns that arise. Regular communication with the development team will help ensure that the project is on track and that any issues are addressed in a timely manner.
- *Testing & feedback*: Active client participation is crucial for successful testing and feedback during UAT sessions. This engagement ensures the solution is ready for your business users in production, leveraging the continuous delivery efforts or our development team. Prompt feedback from the client empowers our squad to make necessary improvements efficiently, enhancing the solution’s quality before the project concludes.
